# `neat` : a Stata layout module to create geometric shapes out of replicates in scatter plot


If you have [github](https://github.com/haghish/github) command installed, you can simply install 
the package by typing:

```{js}
github install haghish/neat
```

Otherwise, you can install it using `net install` command as shown below:

```{js}
net install github, replace from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/neat/master/")
```

### Syntax

The command simply takes 2 Stata variables along with the options required for adjusting the size of 
a scatterplot graph in Stata. The command alters the values of the variables in a way to create 
geometrically appealing shapes out of replicated observations in scatter plots. Therefore, the command 
should be followed by a scatterplot command in Stata.  

### Example

Let's load an example dataset that has replicated observations for 2 variables. 


the **neat3.dta** includes 2 discrete variables named **v1** and **v2**.
Let's begin by creating a scatter plot in Stata:

    .  use "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/neat/master/test/neat3.dta", clear
    .  scatter v1 v2

Now let's apply the **`neat`** engine. This will change the duplicated
observations in **v1** and **v2** variables.

    .  neat v1 v2
    .  scatter v1 v2

`neat` options
--------------

The `neat` layout engine takes several options which are identical to
the options of the **scatter** command in Stata, used for altering the
size of symbols, width of the graph, and height of the graph. If you
wish to alter the default size of the scatter plot in Stata, you can
apply the same options to the `neat` engine, so that it takes the final
shape of the scatter plot into account, when it calculates the
geometiric distances between the duplicated observations.

For example, let's assume you wish to reduce the size of the symbols in
the previous figure. You can use the **msize(num)** option to change the
size of the symbil. For this, you should give the option a real number.
For example, `1.1`, which is smaller than the default value of the
`msize` (i.e. **1.5**).

We can also alter the size of the graph. For instance, let's make the
graph wider by changing the \_\_xsize to 6.5, which is larger than the
default value (i.e. 5.5):

     .  use "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/neat/master/test/neat3.dta", clear
     . neat v1 v2 , msize(1.1) xsize(6.5)
     . scatter v1 v2, msize(1.1) xsize(6.5)

Despite the scalings, the graph still looks fine and the geometric
shapes are in place. Now let's alter another variable, the **dsize**
option which increases the distance between the geometric shapes,
resulting in larger shapes. The default value is 5, so we can try 7!

     . use "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/neat/master/test/neat3.dta", clear
     . neat v1 v2 , dsize(7) 
     . scatter v1 v2
