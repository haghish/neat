> `neat` options
> --------------
> 
> The `neat` layout engine takes several options which are identical to the 
> options of the __scatter__ command in Stata, used for altering the size of 
> symbols, width of the graph, and height of the graph. If you wish to alter the 
> default size of the scatter plot in Stata, you can apply the same options to the 
> `neat` engine, so that it takes the final shape of the scatter plot into account, 
> when it calculates the geometiric distances between the duplicated observations. 
> 
> For example, let's assume you wish to reduce the size of the symbols in the 
> previous figure. You can use the __msize(num)__ option to change the size of the 
> symbil. For this, you should give the option a real number. For example, `1.1`, 
> which is smaller than the default value of the `msize` (i.e. __1.5__). 
> 
> We can also alter the size of the graph. For instance, let's make the graph wider 
> by changing the __xsize to 6.5, which is larger than the default value (i.e. 5.5):
