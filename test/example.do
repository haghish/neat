`neat` layout example
=====================

the __neat3.dta__ includes 2 discrete variables named __v1__ and __v2__. Let's 
begin by creating a scatter plot in Stata:
***/

use "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/neat/master/test/neat3.dta", clear

scatter v1 v2

/***
Now let's apply the __`neat`__ engine. This will change the duplicated 
observations in __v1__ and __v2__ variables.

`neat` options
--------------

The `neat` layout engine takes several options which are identical to the 
options of the __scatter__ command in Stata, used for altering the size of 
symbols, width of the graph, and height of the graph. If you wish to alter the 
default size of the scatter plot in Stata, you can apply the same options to the 
`neat` engine, so that it takes the final shape of the scatter plot into account, 
when it calculates the geometiric distances between the duplicated observations. 

For example, let's assume you wish to reduce the size of the symbols in the 
previous figure. You can use the __msize(num)__ option to change the size of the 
symbil. For this, you should give the option a real number. For example, `1.1`, 
which is smaller than the default value of the `msize` (i.e. __1.5__). 

We can also alter the size of the graph. For instance, let's make the graph wider 
by changing the __xsize to 6.5, which is larger than the default value (i.e. 5.5): 
***/

use "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/neat/master/test/neat3.dta", clear
neat v1 v2 , msize(1.1) xsize(6.5)
scatter v1 v2, msize(1.1) xsize(6.5)

/***
Despite the scalings, the graph still looks fine and the geometric shapes are 
in place. Now let's alter another variable, the __dsize__ option which increases 
the distance between the geometric shapes, resulting in larger shapes. The default 
value is 5, so we can try 7!
